# TASKS

==================================================================================================================

- Placing Enemies into the background with your own Design and Timing

- New Enemies
  - Softshell Turret
    - Attack in a Rotating Strings Pattern
    - Stationary like the Trackers
  - Floating Shark
    - Fly down, float around
    - SHoot in Spread patterns

- Manta's Powers
  - Manta Titan is now the final Boss, will be more Powerful -> defeat to win!
  - Shoot Laser from the middle
  - 2 more Turrets shooting Flowering Pattern Bullets

# PRINCIPLES

==================================================================================================================

## Abstractions

## Checking and Teesting Each Components

## Modular Design

## Prototype!
- A Lot of Iterations!
- Cheap + Fast
  - Focus on the Main Features / Systems before designing smaller Composite Functions
  - You don't need to make everything, just Implement some of them and leave the rest for later Immersion Updates
  - Use Placeholders and Primitive Arts to Implement + Iterate the Mechanics + Programming Functionalities First
- Make things Fully Work + Check if things are Viable + Fun enough
- Aim to Emulate the Full Functional Loop (Game Loop)
  - Ex: Go to Menu -> Select Power-ups -> Select Lvs -> Play -> Go to Shop -> Buy Power-ups -> Rinse and Repeat for the Next Lvs
- After fully tested and fixed -> Consider Adding your Arts 

## Seperate Mechanics and Appearances!

## COde First, Form Later: The Arts and Effects will be saved for later, after the Code base and Scripts are fully Built and Tested
